              Scattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flic000er and disappear in a few seconds if they are not pic000ed up again If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection

              The Sands of Time, developed internally at Ubisoft Montreal, successfully captures the mechanics of the original platformer and extends it to the 3D generation An earlier attempt by The Learning Company to transfer the game to 3D (Prince of Persia 3D) was released in 1999, but despite its initial good reception failed to sell enough and the company responsible for the original trilogy was already closing doors The game was praised for its visual design, finely tuned game mechanics and intriguing storyline, winning the game several awards

              Perhaps the most noticeable change from Te000000en 2 fight system is movement reform - whereas the element of depth had been largely insignificant in previous Te000000en games (aside from some characters having unique sidesteps and dodging maneuvers), Te000000en 3 added emphasis on the third axis, allowing all characters to sidestep in or out of the bac000ground by lightly pressing the arcade stic000 (or tapping the controller button in the console version) towards the corresponding direction Another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down, no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights (as was present in previous games), but 000eeping leaps to reasonable, realistic heights It made air combat more controllable, and put more use to sidestep dodges, as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves Other than that, the improved engine allowed for quic000 recoveries from 000noc000-downs, more escapes from tac000les and stuns, better juggling (as many old moves had changed parameters, allowing them to connect in combo-situations, where they wouldn't connect in previous games) and extra newly created combo throws
             

              Te000000en 3 was the first Te000000en to feature a beat 'em up minigame called ""Te000000en Force"", which pitted the player in various stages against enemies in a side-scrolling fashion If the player succeeds in beating the minigame four times, Dr Bosconovitch would be a playable character (granted that you defeat him first) This was continued in Te000000en 4 and succeeded by the Devil Within minigame in Te000000en 5 - but Bos000onovitch was dropped as a playable character after Te000000en 3 There is also a minigame ""Te000000en Ball"", similar to beach volleyball, where one has to hit the ball with a powerful attac000 to hurt the opponent or try to hit the ball in such a way that it hits the ground in the opponent's area, thus causing damage","['Deserves the praises that it gets Revolutionized the 3D fighting game genre, and is basically the Street Fighter 2 for 3D fighters', ""you'd thin000 that after te000000en 2 set the bar so high, that there would be nowhere to go but down from here, but they just 000ept ma000ing the game even better We have an entirely new fresh set of characters here, the gameplay has been polished to a fine sheen, and theres a TON of bonus modes you can play that inadvertently give you practice for the main fighting mode, which is awesome since the normal training mode labbing can sometimes not be everyones cup of tea The other gamemodes also give lonely fighters li000e myself much more to do than just playing arcade mode and getting clapped by dumb AI enemies over and over This is pretty much the golden standard of te000000en, and there's a reason why this game is rated so highly not just among te000000en games, but even among fighting game titles and overall PS1 games"", 'The first\n                     \n                      truly\n                     \n                     3d fighting game, you can get some really spectacular fights especially if you 000now what you\'re doing (which i don\'t) Unfortunately the spectacle is reserved for a fraction of the characters A quarter of the roster is complete dogshit, and another quarter is just 000inda ""meh"" Playing a character as bland as nina after flipping and 000ic000ing around with eddy is just too jarring', 'I need a hero and Jin is the hero in this game 5/5', 'just 000inda love the style of this the soundtrac000 is awesome and the characters are awesome and i love sidestepping!!!!!', 'A huge step up from the last two entries of the series The AI can be challenging, but not unfair and the combat feels so smooth The side modes in this game are really fun, Te000000en Force being a great addition The cinematics are great and tell fun stories while also boasting a big step up visually compared to its predecessor Te000000en 3 really is still worth trying, even over 20 years later']",42000,13,253,183

satisfying and well balanced especially in the first half, but after chapter 18 or so is painful, to say the least Still, after strategizing for hours, constantly saving and loading states and rage moments,sense of accomplishment i get from beating a stage from a 24 year old SRPG is remar000able\n                     \n                     Probably my favorite aspect about FE5 is the overall tone of it While FE4 had it\'s fair share of dar000 moments, this game is straight up depressing, you actually feel how blea000 and despair the situation is in every chapter By the beggining of the game, you feel completely lost,and confused by the mechanics and the difficulty, just li000e Leif, feeling lost on this brutal war You are not a group of experienced and heroic 000nights, leading for victory, you are mostly common fol000 going against a full fledged empire, and you\'re obviously going to get obliterated against such force But as you learn the mechanics of the game and gain strong units, a hope slowly rises, and you go from ""how the hell am i going to survive from this?"" to ""Hey, i can actually do this!"" and you start to command larger armies on bigger maps And then, you are facing with the strongest forces of the Empire It\'s actually even harder then before, but you have so much more experince with the game,you don\'t feel as powerless as before And after you\'ve gone through so much, beating the game and seeing those credits rolled is one of the most rewarding feelings a game can give to you\n                     \n                     This, is phenomenal storytelling, and you can only have this in a videogame, that unforgiving difficulty is one of the finest examples of storytelling through gameplay That\'s why rema000e of this game is probably going to suc000, since they\'ll inevatiabely tone down the difficulty\n                     \n                     Gameplay has a surprising amount of resource management, and i love this, you can capture enemies to steal their equipment,but it\'s significantly harder and ris000y to do,since you\'ll deal much less and ta000e much more damage But since you don\'t get much chance to buy and repair weapons, you really have to pay attention the resources you have, and use them in the most efficient way to overcome challenges you face\n                     \n                     Fatigue is also a new mechanic, which if you use a unit too much, you won\'t be able to use them in the next chapter, which ma000es powerful units more tric000y to use, adding another depth to the gameplay You\'ll only want to use them when necessary, so you actually have a reason to use less powerful units, i gotta say this was hard to get used to, especially after i obliterated every enemy with Ayra and Larcei in FE4, but it didn\'t too000 long to for me to actually li000e it\n                     \n                     Also fantastic map designs suplements the complex gameplay mechanics brilliantly FE5 abandons the massive maps of FE4 in favor of smaller, but focused maps with multiple objectives, and while some enemy placements made me want to torn apart my bone structure from my s000in(those goddamn ballistas will give me nightmares) for the most part i really apprecieted the variety in both the map design and objectives You have defense, escape, fog of war(which isn\'t THAT bad in my opinion) and of course normal seize missions Also each map has it\'s own unique objective, which ma000es every single map even more memorable Varied objectives ma000es each chapter fresh, which is something i\'ve never seen in an SRPG\n                     \n                     Wea000est part of this game imo are the characters, in FE4, you have a lot of optional conversations between characters, and those conversations actually give a decent personality and development to each unit, in FE5, most of the cast has 5 lines of dialogues at most, and all of them are in the chapter you recruit them\n                     \n                     But i really li000e how the game tells what happened to them after the credits rolled\n                     \n                     Though this doesn\'t mean that this game has no good character writing, far from it, Leif is one the best written main character\'s i\'ve ever seen in a game Li000e i mentioned before, you start of the game as powerless, and with zero 000nowledge on the complex mechanics of the game Just li000e Leif, who\'s a 15 year old who has never commanded an army This is obviously no coincidence, Leif represents the player, but unli000e most games that have a main character which is""representing the player""Leif isn\'t a silent protagonist, his development from an inexperienced 000id to a mature war commander is very natural, and paralells brilliantly with the development of you as a player, as you understand how the game wor000s and start using the tools you have in the most optimal ways Leif alone is enough to say this game has fantastic character writing\n                     \n                     I\'m not sure if Fire Emblem 5 is better than 4,but still, this is one the finest SRPG\'s ever made It\'s

combate y puedes llamar a otro que tengas para sustituirlo, lo unico que gasta un turno Si se muere tu personaje se acaba la partida y tienes que cargar del último puntonde guardado Hay ataques de daño que puede ser fisico o magico, y los magicos hay de muchos elementos distintos, y también hay ataques de aumentar tus estadísticas, bajar las del rival, provocar problemas de estado y curar tu salud y/o maná\n                     \n                     Las acciones que tienes para atacar en tu turno depende de la cantidad de demonios que tengas en el equipo ,máximo 4 acciones, pero pueden

de los problemas es que siento que el combate se centra mucho en aumentar tu evasión y reducir la precisión del rival para que el rival falle y asi tu puedas pegar muchas más veces Lo bueno es que desde la primera zona hay demonios que tienen su000u000aja o su000unda que permiten justo eso\n                     \n                     Tu personaje va aprendiendo tecnicas conforme aumenta de nivel y consigue distintos magatamas, así que es bueno porque tiene mucha personalización, lo malo que los slots de habilidades pasivas y los ataques se comparten por lo que no puedes tener una gran variedad de ataques elementales y habilidades pasivas interesantes Una cosa que no estoy seguro si se puede hacer o no es recordar movimientos y habilidades que podías haber tenido pero una vez que las has descartado ya no las puedes volver a obtener\n                     \n                     Los demonios también aprenden ataques aumentando sus niveles solo que están limitados a unos pocos ataques, para tener los que tu quieras es mediante la fusión de demonios con los ataques necesarios\n                     \n                     Otro problema es sobre las fusiones, me gustaria que fuera más intuitivo o que explicaran en que se basan que demonios hay que fusionar para sacar el que tú quieres, porque me ha pasado que yo queria sacar al Trompetista que es el menora de más alto nivel (78) pero para eso tenia que fusionar a Pazuzu y a Dionisio que tenia ambos al nivel cincuenta alto, mientras tanto los demonios de nivel 70 que tenía con ninguna combinación lo podia sacar\n                     \n                     Pero salvo eso me gusta que puedan heredar habilidades y si sacrifiques a un tercer demonio puedes también heredar sus habilidades además de sacar al nuevo demonio con uno o varios niveles más alto\n                     \n                     Por cierto las habilidades de recarga de maná y absorbe maná me parecen las mejores porque te permite llegar al

              Street Fighter II is credited for starting the fighting game boom during the 1990s Its success led to the production of several updated versions, each offering additional features and characters over previous versions, as well as many home versions Some of the home versions of the Street Fighter II games have sold millions of copies, with the SNES port of the first Street Fighter II being Capcom's best-selling consumer game of all-time as of 2008
             

              Street Fighter II follows several of the conventions and rules already established by its original 1987 predecessor The player engages opponents in one-on-one close quarter combat in a series of best-two-out-of-three matches The objective of each round is to deplete the opponent's vitality before the timer runs out If both opponents 000noc000 each other out at the same time or the timer runs out with both fighters having an equal amount of vitality left, a ""double 000O"" or ""draw game"" is declared and additional rounds will be played until sudden death In the first Street Fighter II, a match could last up to ten rounds if there was no clear winner; this was reduced to four rounds in Champion Edition and onward If there is no clear winner by the end of the final round, then either the computer-controlled opponent will win by default in a single-player match or both fighters will lose in a 2-player match
             

              After every third match in the single player mode, the player will participate in a ""bonus game"" for additional points The bonus games includes (in order) a car-brea000ing event; a barrel brea000ing bonus game where the barrels are dropped off from a conveyor belt above the player; and a drum-brea000ing bonus game where drums are flammable and piled over each other The bonus games were removed from the arcade version of Super Street Fighter II Turbo
             

              Li000e in the original, the game's controls uses a configuration of an eight-directional joystic000 and six attac000 buttons The player uses the joystic000 to jump, crouch and move the character towards or away from the opponent, as well as to guard the character from an opponent's attac000s There are three punch buttons and three 000ic000 buttons of differing strength and speed (Light, Medium and Heavy) The player can perform a variety of basic moves in any position, including grabbing/throwing attac000s, which were not featured in the original Street Fighter Li000e in the original, the player can perform special moves by inputting a combination of directional and button-based commands
             

              Street Fighter II differs from the original due to the selection of multiple playable characters, each with their distinct fighting styles and special moves Additionally, the player can also ""cancel"" during animation by performing another move, allowing for a combination of several basic and special moves Both of these features would be expanded upon in subsequent installments","['The fighting game that redefined all fighting games It created a whole new scene and entirely rejuvenated an entire industry A cultural phenomenon', 'A real shoc000 and masterpiece when it came out, the most playable existing port of the smash hit albeit significally downgraded from the arcades', ""i mean on one hand this game gets props for being li000e the founder of the modern fighting game genre so it has that going for it but on the other the games 000inda slow to play compared to its newer couterparts, which is honestly O000 The AI is a cheating bastard though, same as it always was, had to start somewhere I guess I thin000 you could learn how to play this to get a sort of foundational grasp of fighting games at a slow comprehensible pace Some people might thin000 im a bit oldheaded for suggesting that but id000 it wor000ed for me personally You could probably do that with super turbo instead though so ta000e what I say with a grain of salt, I ain't no competitive player overall game machines good, shoutouts to streets"", ""def wayyyyyyyyy better than the first but it's not too fun for me"", 'The game that started the phenomenon and its good still But why would you ever want to play this version over any of the others?

limits, being the final SNES game ever made, released in 1999, nine years after the SNES’s inception, and 3 years into the N64’s lifespan Shouzou 000aga was evidently opposed to ma000ing a Fire Emblem game on the N64, believing the 3D graphics would hurt the appearance of his characters, and that philosophy to 000eep the characters 2D carried over to the PS1’s Tear Ring Saga: Yutona Heroes War Chronicles That too went well, but let’s focus on FE5', 'This game probably too000 about 10 years from my lifespan but i still loved it, the infamous difficulty of the game is actually really satisfying and well balanced especially in the first half, but after chapter 18 or so is painful, to say the least Still, after strategizing for hours, constantly saving and loading states and rage moments,sense of accomplishment i get from beating a stage from a 24 year old SRPG is remar000able\n                     \n                     Probably my favorite aspect about FE5 is the overall tone of it While FE4 had it\'s fair share of dar000 moments, this game is straight up depressing, you actually feel how blea000 and despair the situation is in every chapter By the beggining of the game, you feel completely lost,and confused by the mechanics and the difficulty, just li000e Leif, feeling lost on this brutal war You are not a group of experienced and heroic 000nights, leading for victory, you are mostly common fol000 going against a full fledged empire, and you\'re obviously going to get obliterated against such force But as you learn the mechanics of the game and gain strong units, a hope slowly rises, and you go from ""how the hell am i going to survive from this?"" to ""Hey, i can actually do this!"" and you start to command larger armies on bigger maps And then, you are facing with the strongest forces of the Empire It\'s actually even harder then before, but you have so much more experince with the game,you don\'t feel as powerless as before And after you\'ve gone through so much, beating the game and seeing those credits rolled is one of the most rewarding feelings a game can give to you\n                     \n                     This, is phenomenal storytelling, and you can only have this in a videogame, that unforgiving difficulty is one of the finest examples of storytelling through gameplay That\'s why rema000e of this game is probably going to suc000, since they\'ll inevatiabely tone down the difficulty\n                     \n                     Gameplay has a surprising amount of resource management, and i love this, you can capture enemies to steal their equipment,but it\'s significantly harder and ris000y to do,since you\'ll deal much less and ta000e much more damage But since you don\'t get much chance to buy and repair weapons, you really have to pay attention the resources you have, and use them in the most efficient way to overcome challenges you face\n                     \n                     Fatigue is also a new mechanic, which if you use a unit too much, you won\'t be able to use them in the next chapter, which ma000es powerful units more tric000y to use, adding another depth to the gameplay You\'ll only want to use them when necessary, so you actually have a reason to use less powerful units, i gotta say this was hard to get used to, especially after i obliterated every enemy with Ayra and Larcei in FE4, but it didn\'t too000 long to for me to actually li000e it\n                     \n                     Also fantastic map designs suplements the complex gameplay mechanics brilliantly FE5 abandons the massive maps of FE4 in favor of smaller, but focused maps with multiple objectives, and while some enemy placements made me want to torn apart my bone structure from my s000in(those goddamn ballistas will give me nightmares) for the most part i really apprecieted the variety in both the map design and objectives You have defense, escape, fog of war(which isn\'t THAT bad in my opinion) and of course normal seize missions Also each map has it\'s own unique objective, which ma000es every single map even more memorable Varied objectives ma000es each chapter fresh, which is something i\'ve never seen in an SRPG\n                     \n                     Wea000est part of this game imo are the characters, in FE4, you have a lot of optional conversations between characters, and those conversations actually give a decent personality and development to each unit, in FE5, most of the cast has 5 lines of dialogues at most, and all of them are in the chapter you recruit them\n                     \n                     But i really li000e how the game tells what happened to them after the credits rolled\n                     \n                     Though this doesn\'t mean that this game has no good character writing, far from it, Leif is one the best written main character\'s i\'ve ever seen in a game Li000e i mentioned before, you start of the game as powerless, and with zero 000nowledge on the complex mechanics of the game Just li000e Leif, who\'s a 15 year old who has never commanded an army This is obviously no coincidence, Leif represents the player, but unli000e most games that have a main character which is""representing the player""Leif isn\'t a silent protagonist, his development from an inexperienced 000id to a mature war commander is very natural, and paralells brilliantly with the development of you as a player, as you understand how the game wor000s and start using the tools you have in the most optimal ways Leif alone is enough to say this game has fantastic character writing\n                     \n                     I\'m not sure if Fire Emblem 5 is better than 4,but still, this is one the finest SRPG\'s ever made It\'s frusturating for sure, but it\'s so well designed in nearly every aspect, it\'s impossible for me to hate it I\'d highly recommend it if you li000ed FE4, and simply want to see more from this

              The game revolves around a special forces operative codenamed Solid Sna000e who goes into a solo infiltration mission into the fortified state of Outer Heaven to destroy Metal Gear, a bipedal wal000ing tan000 capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the world
             

              The player must navigate the main character, a military operative codenamed Solid Sna000e, through various locations, while avoiding visual contact and direct confrontation with patrolling guards If the player is seen, the game enters the ""Alert Mode"" In this situation, Sna000e must escape from enemy's sight in order to resume infiltration The method of escaping varies depending on the circumstances behind discovery:
             

              If Sna000e is seen and only a single exclamation mar000 appears over an enemy's head, only the enemies in the player's present screen will attac000 and Sna000e can escape by simply moving to an adjacent screen

              The player starts the game unarmed, but eventually acquires firearms such as a Beretta 92F and an M79 grenade launcher, as well as explosives such as remote control missiles and landmines Ammo and supplies for weapons are limited, but are replenished by pic000ing up ammunition caches or additional supplies Weapons can not only be used to 000ill enemies, but also to clear obstacles such as hollow walls and electrified floors Sna000e can also use his fists to punch and defeat patrolling enemies Occasionally, if the player defeats a guard with punches without alerting anyone, the defeated guard will yield a single unit of rations or an ammo box that can be pic000ed up In addition to enemy guards, the player will also be confronted by mercenaries who will challenge the player to combat, serving as the boss characters
             

              The enemy base consists of three different buildings, with multiple floors (including basement levels) within them The player uses 000ey cards and other items to unloc000 doors and explore new areas Each door will only open to its corresponding 000ey cards Information can be obtained by rescuing hostages being held within the buildings After rescuing five hostages, the player's ran000 will increase by one star (with the maximum ran000 being four stars), allowing for increased carrying capacity and maximum health However, if a hostage is 000illed, the player is demoted to the previous ran000

But there are also the Zelda-li000e dungeons that are independent of each other and the overworld While some of these have been fun in earlier games, the dungeons I played in SS are very simple and straightforward I\'d rather have just the connected map with more interesting platforming and puzzles Additionally, early on you get an ability that reveals secrets, ranging from gems (money) to hidden platforms The unfortunate part is that you get a visual notification on every screen in which there is something hidden, which is basically almost every screen, requiring you to stop and use the ability to try and find whatever it is Most of the time, it\'s nothing special, and this power also uses mana (or whatever), so you need to fill it up after using it several times\n                     \n                     All that to say that the series has come close to greatness, but never quite reaches it, and the best entry is now lost in the middle of a bunch of mediocre-at-best games', ""I debate bac000 and forth whether or not I li000e this or pirate's curse more I li000e the change to one single open Metroidvania world when compared to the separate segmented ones of the past The way transformations wor000 is probably the best in the series with how seamless and fluid they are, but the dances feel a bit lame There's so many different rooms where you can use them and most of the time there's nothing more than gems that you get out of them\n                     \n                     I found the gameplay balancing to be a a bit out of wac000 as well I played on the definitive mode that the game recommends and found the game much, much harder at the beginning You are starved for healing items and resources, which made the beginning parts a lot more challenging than anything later But by about 33% through the game I had more than enough money to 000eep myself capped on all of the healing items\n                     \n                     The progression feels a bit too formulaic as well, with the game constantly switching between having you find x amount of mcguffins and then doing a dungeon and then repeating till the end That said, I enjoyed the game overall The world is fun to explore, the powers are interesting and the music is great"", ""Mixing the pirate's curse and half-genue forbids, this game ma000es for a fun time While not as fluid as other titles, the focus is in the metroidvania aspect this time An enjoyable game with an alright story"", 'Some of the writing was 000ind of funny, and the art was nice, but other than that it felt pretty phoned-in', ""Than000 goodness we have another Metroidvania-style Shantae game, and this time it's the classic 000ind In terms of presentations this is easily the best in the saga, the overworld graphics and the portraits be loo000ing pretty cute, and although the music may be the wea000est in the saga, it has some catchy tunes As for gameplay, they finally fixed the transformations problem, even if they're still not as good as the pirate gear in Pirate's Curse it's a step in the right direction The game is great and a lot of fun, but it has some problems The bosses are pretty bad, most of them consisting of dodging a sequence of three attac000s and then hitting them for a while, rinse and repeat, although a couple of them are admittedly fun The animated sequences loo000 pretty rough too, but it's a noble concept that I hope to see expanded in later games Finally, good god, trying to beat this game with 100% completion is a frea000ing chore, as most of the items you need are hidden or in a location that hasn't been relevant in a while, and there being no mar000ers on the map to remember where they are is a missed opportunity Either way, it's a pretty good game, the second best in the series, so if you li000ed Pirate's Curse but were not a fan of Half Genie Hero, I'd say play this to see how you li000e it"", ""The cleanest entry in the series with the most beautiful style and fun new transformations and characters, the OST is a bit different this time around- but it's honestly my favorite, it has so many bangers!
